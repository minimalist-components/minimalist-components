A lot of components ui, with a design minimalist.



#### THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO COMPLEXION REDUCTION

1. Remove Color. Well ok, you can have one color, but use it extremely sparingly to indicate action. Everything else better be black and white. Let the content of your app bring the color.

2. Bigger, Bolder, Blacker Headlines. You see that headline there? Bump it up about 20 to 30 pixels and make it HEAVY.

3. Simple, Thin, Recognizable Icons. Your icons better be universal and no color allowed here either. And if you want bonus points order them left to right in this way: home, search, primary action, secondary action, profile.

4. Double, NO, Triple your White Space. Maybe even quadruple it. You really canâ€™t go wrong here.

5. Make your App Icon Brighter. If you are fiending to design something with flash and color, make it the app icon. This is where you put your personality and brand. And make it stand out!
