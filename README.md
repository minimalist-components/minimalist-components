# minimalist components

A lot of components ui, with a design minimalist.

The components can be used separated from this module, i.e, you can use just a button in a landing page, instead use the entire module with all other components.

At moment, we want include in mn-components:


- [mn-layout](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-layout)
- [mn-form](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-form)
- [mn-button](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-button)
- [mn-image](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-image)
- [mn-card](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-card)
- [mn-input](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-input) (just text, email or password)
- [mn-number](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-number)
- [mn-textarea](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-textarea)
- [mn-checkbox](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-checkbox)
- [mn-radio](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-radio)
- [mn-table-list](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-table-list)
- [mn-dialog](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-dialog)
- [mn-sidenav](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-sidenav)
