# minimalist components

A lot of components ui, with a design minimalist.

The components can be used separated from this module, i.e, you can use just a button in a landing page, instead use the entire module with all other components.

At moment, we want include in minimalist-components:

- [mn-input](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-input) (just text, email or password)
- [mn-button](https://github.com/minimalist-components/mn-button)

and we will discouse about what others components be require to a first release ([issue](https://github.com/minimalist-components/minimalist-components/issues))
